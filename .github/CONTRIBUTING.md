**READ THIS SECTION IN IT'S ENTIERTY BEFORE PUSHING ANY CODE TO THE REPOSITORY**

If you've never used git before it is **highly** reccomended that you go through this [codeacademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) before proceeding. 

It is essential that you understand the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) before proceeding.

**ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS PUSH CODE TO A SEPARATE BRANCH**
NEVER push new code to the `main` branch. Ever. 

1. First [create your branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
2. Next, click on the `Fetch Origin` button
3. Finally, click on the `Current Branch` button. Select the branch you just made.

## Commiting

This is how we send your code to your new branch.

1. **BE ABSOLUTELY SURE** that you are NOT in the `master` branch.
3. On the left hand column, make sure that **ONLY** the files you want to push are checked. 
5. Title and put in a description of your commit.
    **NOTE:** ALWAYS fill out your message with a basic summary of what you changed.
4. Commit your code by clicking the blue `commit` button.
5. Finally, push your code to the repo by pressing `push to origin` in the top right.

You've successfully submitted your first commit! Congrats! (ï¾‰^ãƒ®^)ï¾‰*:ãƒ»ï¾Ÿâœ§

## Pull Requests

We merge code from your branch to the `main` branch using Pull Requests. To learn how pull requests work [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 

**ENSURE YOU ARE MAKING A PR TO OUR REPO AND NOT THE OFFICIAL FTC REPO**
